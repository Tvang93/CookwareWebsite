Project: Cookware Website

Brief Description:
    Create web representation of Prototype provided 
    Responsives for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile Version via figma 
    Use of CSS systems and Framework for responsiveness - Grid, Flexbox and BootStrap
    Use the following for at least one section of cards: Flex box, CSS Grid and bootstrap. For the flex box and grid sections there should be no bootstrap classes used.
    No use of the bootstrap "card" class - IE creating your own cards  
    Use CSS systems to style the site. But you must use each one at least one

Desktop: 
1.the only thing I can  see different from figma is the alignment of the 3rd column in the best sellers section. The height should be the same as the 2nd column. 
2. for the new arrivals  you can add a white border for the first color selector to get it as close to figma prototype



Mobile
1. the best sellers section can use some padding between cards when stacked on top of each other
2. logo image can be smaller to be proportional to the menu toggle button
3. off canvass menu links should be centered and not left aligned

Overall :  

looks perfect! I've looked at other people's work and  this is a project I can't do much nitpicking!  :)  


-- saw feedback would implement but ran out of time.
